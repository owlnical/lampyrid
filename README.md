Lampyrid
--------

In Lampyrid you control a spaceship by typing in commnds in a terminal.

### Features

We're in early days yet, and there isn't a whole lot of features. Yet. You can find nearby planets with the ships sensors and travel to said planets in real time, but that's about it.

What I'd like to implement is some sort of economy/trading system and allow the player to transport goods between planets.
